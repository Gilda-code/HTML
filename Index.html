<h5><i><b>The Human factor</b></i></h5>

<p id="specialstyle">	The emotional factor in investing plays a critical role, 
	often leading to impulsive decisions that can undermine a well-thought-out strategy. 
	Fear and greed are the two dominant emotions that can cloud judgment—fear may push investors to sell in panic during market downturns, 
	while greed can cause overconfidence and risky bets during market highs. Managing emotions, 
	staying disciplined, and adhering to long-term goals are essential to avoiding costly mistakes driven by short-term market fluctuations. 
	Emotional control is just as important as financial analysis when it comes to successful investing.</p>
